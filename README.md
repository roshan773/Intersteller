# API HUNTER

This project is a **React-based application** that allows users to view and manage a list of tech products fetched from an external API. The application features authentication via login, a dashboard to list the products in a table, and a detailed view for individual products. This project is designed to handle authentication, product listing, and navigation to a productâ€™s detailed page seamlessly.

## Features

- **Login Page**: Allows users to log in using the `reqres.in` API.
- **Dashboard**: Displays a paginated list of tech products in a table format. Each product can be clicked to view detailed information on a separate page.
- **Single Product Page**: Displays detailed information about a single product when a user clicks on the product's brand on the Dashboard page.
- **Private Routes**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access the Dashboard and Single Product Pages.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, making it accessible across devices like smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
